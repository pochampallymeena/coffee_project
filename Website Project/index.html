  <blockquote>
    We want to do a lot of stuff; we're not in great shape. We didn't get a good night's sleep. We're a little depressed.
    Coffee solves all these problems in one delightful little cup.
    - Jerry Seinfeld

    <p>Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the particular steps vary with
       the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps; raw coffee beans must be
      roasted,the roasted coffee beans must then be ground, the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a
      certain time (brewed), and finally the liquid coffee must be separated from the used grounds.</p>

    <p>Coffee is usually  <a href="brewing.html">brewed</a> immediately before <a href="drinks.html">drinking</a>.
       In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed, or already roasted, or already
        <a href="roasting.html">roasted</a> and <a href="grinding.html">ground</a>. Coffee is often vacuum packed to
        prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life.</p>
